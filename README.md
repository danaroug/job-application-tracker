# Job Application Tracker (WIP)

⚙️ **Work in Progress** — This is a learning project where I'm building a full-stack job application tracker using ASP.NET Core (backend) and React (frontend).  
I’m experimenting and learning React, so expect some rough edges and updates!

---

## What it does so far

- Simple backend API to store and fetch jobs
- React frontend that fetches and displays job listings
- Basic filtering and status display (more features coming!)

---

## Tech stack

- Backend: ASP.NET Core Web API + EF Core (SQLite)
- Frontend: React (functional components, hooks)
- Swagger for API docs

---

## How to run it

### Backend

```bash
cd JobTracker.API
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```
